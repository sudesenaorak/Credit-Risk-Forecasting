# Machine Learning for Credit Risk Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains machine learning models for analyzing credit risk using the German Credit Risk dataset. The models included are:

- Gradient Boosting Classifier (GBC)
- k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Logistic Regression (LR)
- Random Forest Classifier (RFC)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

These models are trained on the dataset to learn the risk associated with credit applicants and make forecasts based on their attributes.

## Dataset

The German Credit Risk dataset contains information about credit applicants, including features such as age, income, and credit history, along with a binary label indicating whether the applicant is considered a good or bad credit risk.

## Usage

To use these models, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
3. Run the desired model script (e.g., `gbc_model.py`, `knn_model.py`, etc.) to train the model and make predictions.

## Results

The performance of each model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The results are presented in the respective model scripts and can be further analyzed for model selection and tuning.

## Conclusion

These machine learning models can be used to assess credit risk and make informed decisions about credit applicants. Further improvements and optimizations can be made to enhance the performance of the models.
